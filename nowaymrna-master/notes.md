# What is mRNA

Above is source for figure 1

mRNA = messenger RNA, takes data from DNA, moves to ribosome which makes proteins

Dna is copied into mRNA

# What is mRNA splicing

Video by North Dakota State University:

Video is 2 minutes long, explains the process pretty okay.

Here's a shorter, clearer video:

Bonus, transcript is here:

Above link - After pre-rna is formed, introns are removed via splicing, by the spliceosome

# What goes wrong?

This link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3131313/ suggests "approximately one third of all disease-causing mutations alter pre-mRNA splicing"

Alternative splicing: https://bitesizebio.com/10148/what-is-alternative-splicing-and-why-is-it-important/ Says its important

I need to keep writing 2 sections per hour to finish by 11

# What happens as a result?

This paper is Gold.

http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/17/4/419.full.

Lists a huge amount of diseases caused by point mutations, which alter pre-mRNA splicing, which alters the proteins produced.


# Why does it go wrong

Environmental Factors cause mutations in DNA: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128092705000054

Radiation is a physical mutagen: https://www.britannica.com/science/mutagen

A list of common carcinogens: https://www.webmd.com/cancer/know-common-carcinogens#1

Carcinogens are not necessarily mutagens: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21788/

Due to the above, I'm taking each item from the list of carcinogens and researching them separately.

Second hand tobacco smoke is a mutagen in male germ cells: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150936/

# What can be done to avoid it going wrong


# Grading

- Cover topic in-depth
	- QA format, logical step-by-step going through
- explanations, examples, applications
	- Examples? I can cite papers, it's hard to find examples for this. Might loose points here.
- Acessible to High school audience
	- Voice, should be fine
- Sources in APA
	- I accept I'll be losing points here.

- Visually Interesting
	- Colors; drop shadow on text; solid design. Should be good here.
- Engaging content - joy to read (Voice, Pictures, Videos?)
	- TODO find more pictures
- Clarity / organization / logical flow
	- Setup as series of questions, very logical flow (QA format), should be fine here

			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p>
				mRNA is a critical component in every cell of your body. It transports
				the data used in the protein building process. Sometimes, something
				goes wrong. Keep reading to find out what happens, what's at risk, and
				what you can do about it.
			</p>
			<a id='whatis' class='jump'></a>
			<h2>What is mRNA?</h2>
			<p>
				To understand mRNA, we need some context on two other components
				within the cell: DNA, and ribosomes.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>DNA</b> is stored in the nucleus of the cell, and contains the
				cell's genetic information. This genetic information contains
				instructions on how to build <i>proteins</i>, which are the
				primary means of constructing and operating the cell.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Ribosomes</b> are like little machines all over the cell,
				waiting to build proteins. All they need is the information held
				by the DNA, and they'll get right to work. Unfortunately, that
				information is highly protected - it's hidden inside the nucleus.
				The DNA can't come out, and the ribosomes can't go in.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is where mRNA comes in.
			</p>
			<p>
				A handy enzyme called <i>RNA Polymerase</i>	also lives inside
				the nucleus. This enzyme zips along the DNA, building pre-mRNA as it
				goes. The pre-mRNA is <b>spliced</b> into mRNA, or messenger RNA - which, unline the DNA,
				can leave the nucleus with the DNA's information.
			</p>
			<p>
				From here, our messenger RNA escapes the nucleus and meets up
				with a ribosome. The ribosome uses the mRNA's information to build
				a protein, and the mRNA is broken down and recycled.

			<h2>What is mRNA Splicing?</h2>
			<p>
				Pre-mRNA is a complementary copy of the DNA, which has a lot of extra information.
				Some parts are going to be used (Extrons), and some parts are extra that need to be removed (Introns).
			</p>
			<p>
				Some helper proteins form a <i>spliceosome</i>, which removes the extra information. Here's a handy video from dnalc.org that explains the process:

			<h2>What could possibly go wrong?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Including introns</li>
				<li>Excluding extrons</li>
				<li>Or, more extreme, including/excluding a part of an intron/extron.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Mixing and matching which extrons are included happens naturally.
				Dropping an extron here or there intentionally is called <i>Alternative Splicing</i>, and
				you can read more about it <a href="https://bitesizebio.com/10148/what-is-alternative-splicing-and-why-is-it-important/">here.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				However, when there are mutations that affect where splicing takes place, sections may be included/dropped that
				should not have been included/dropped.
			</p>
			<h2>That sounds bad - What happens as a result?</h2>
			<p>
				When a mutation occurs in DNA, this may affect the splice locations of
				the pre-mRNA made from that DNA. As a result, incorrect mRNA, and therefore incorrect proteins, are produced.
				This leads to a long list of potential genetic diseases:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Familial isolated Growth Hormone Deficiency type II</li>
				<li>Wilms Tumours - pediatric kidney cancer</li>
				<li>Denys-Drash syndrome</li>
				<li>Fraisier syndrome</li>
				<li>Cystic Fibrosis</li>
				<li>Retinis Pigmentosa - progressive retinal degernation, affects 1 in 4000 people</li>
				<li>Spinal muscular atrophy</li>
				<li>And more</li>
				<li> <a href="http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/17/4/419.full.">Source</a> </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Note - A single cell with a mutation will not necesarily lead to the
				above - Inheriting mutated DNA, however, propogates the mutation throughout
				the entire body. This, in some cases, is bad.
			</p>
			<h2>This is Outrageous! Who's responsible?</h2>
			<p>
				As seen above, mutations in DNA that are passed on to the next generation
				have the capability of causing problems.
			</p>
			<a id='prevent' class='jump'></a>
			<h2>What can I do to avoid this?</h2>
			<p>
				Let's trace the chain of events backwards, and re-phrase the question:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The diseases above are caused by incorrect proteins</li>
				<li>Incorrect proteins are made by ribosomes processing incorrect mRNA</li>
				<li>Incorrect mRNA comes from incorrect splicing of pre-mRNA</li>
				<li>Incorrect splicing happens due to mutations in DNA</li>
				<li>Mutations in DNA are caused mainly by environmental factors ( <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128092705000054">Source</a> )</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>What environmental factors should I avoid, to prevent passing on mutated DNA to future generations?</h2>
			<p>
				In conclusion, to avoid mutations in DNA that could put future generations at risk,
				One should avoid certain environmental factors. These mutation causing
				factors are commonly called <i>Mutagens</i>. Note that exposure does not guarantee mutation - X rays are
				very common, and most of us encounter UV rays from the sun every day. High exposure, or
				continued, prolonged exposure, is much more reasonable to be concerned about.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some mutagens to avoid:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ionizing Radiation (Such as X-Rays)</li>
				<li>Low-Energy Radiation (UV light)</li>
				<li>Tobacco smoke (Even second hand [ <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150936/">Source</a> ])</li>
				<li>Radon [ <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/health/case_studies/radon.html">Source</a> ]</li>
				<li>Asbestos [ <a href="http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/52/22/6305.full.pdf">Source</a> ]</li>
			</ul>

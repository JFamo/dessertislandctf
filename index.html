			<h2><i class="fa fa-birthday-cake"></i> WELCOME TO THE ISLAND</h2>
			<p>
				You are dozing off in AP computer science. Jimbo is looking at Yahoo news. Nobody around you understands the programs. Slowly but surely your mind drifts to the infinitely more interesting world of cyber security... but you missed lunch. You're so hungry. Welcome to the dessert island.
			</p>
			<p>
				With your <i>vast</i> knowledge of CTF games and cyber security, you're certain you can obtain some scrumptious desserts from this land of bountiful sweetness. Maybe some diabetes and high cholesterol in the proccess.
			</p>
			<p>
				Perhaps some of the animated human treats - which you are certain can be nothing more than figments of a starving imagination - will provide some assistance in obtaining the flags you need to secure your dietary fulfillment.

			<h2>MEET THE PEOPLE</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Including introns</li>
				<li>Excluding extrons</li>
				<li>Or, more extreme, including/excluding a part of an intron/extron.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Mixing and matching which extrons are included happens naturally.
				Dropping an extron here or there intentionally is called <i>Alternative Splicing</i>, and
				you can read more about it <a href="https://bitesizebio.com/10148/what-is-alternative-splicing-and-why-is-it-important/">here.</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				However, when there are mutations that affect where splicing takes place, sections may be included/dropped that
				should not have been included/dropped.
			</p>
			<h2>That sounds bad - What happens as a result?</h2>
			<p>
				When a mutation occurs in DNA, this may affect the splice locations of
				the pre-mRNA made from that DNA. As a result, incorrect mRNA, and therefore incorrect proteins, are produced.
				This leads to a long list of potential genetic diseases:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Familial isolated Growth Hormone Deficiency type II</li>
				<li>Wilms Tumours - pediatric kidney cancer</li>
				<li>Denys-Drash syndrome</li>
				<li>Fraisier syndrome</li>
				<li>Cystic Fibrosis</li>
				<li>Retinis Pigmentosa - progressive retinal degernation, affects 1 in 4000 people</li>
				<li>Spinal muscular atrophy</li>
				<li>And more</li>
				<li> <a href="http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/17/4/419.full.">Source</a> </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Note - A single cell with a mutation will not necesarily lead to the
				above - Inheriting mutated DNA, however, propogates the mutation throughout
				the entire body. This, in some cases, is bad.
			</p>
			<h2>This is Outrageous! Who's responsible?</h2>
			<p>
				As seen above, mutations in DNA that are passed on to the next generation
				have the capability of causing problems.
			</p>
			<a id='prevent' class='jump'></a>
			<h2>What can I do to avoid this?</h2>
			<p>
				Let's trace the chain of events backwards, and re-phrase the question:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The diseases above are caused by incorrect proteins</li>
				<li>Incorrect proteins are made by ribosomes processing incorrect mRNA</li>
				<li>Incorrect mRNA comes from incorrect splicing of pre-mRNA</li>
				<li>Incorrect splicing happens due to mutations in DNA</li>
				<li>Mutations in DNA are caused mainly by environmental factors ( <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128092705000054">Source</a> )</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>What environmental factors should I avoid, to prevent passing on mutated DNA to future generations?</h2>
			<p>
				In conclusion, to avoid mutations in DNA that could put future generations at risk,
				One should avoid certain environmental factors. These mutation causing
				factors are commonly called <i>Mutagens</i>. Note that exposure does not guarantee mutation - X rays are
				very common, and most of us encounter UV rays from the sun every day. High exposure, or
				continued, prolonged exposure, is much more reasonable to be concerned about.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some mutagens to avoid:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ionizing Radiation (Such as X-Rays)</li>
				<li>Low-Energy Radiation (UV light)</li>
				<li>Tobacco smoke (Even second hand [ <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150936/">Source</a> ])</li>
				<li>Radon [ <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/health/case_studies/radon.html">Source</a> ]</li>
				<li>Asbestos [ <a href="http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/52/22/6305.full.pdf">Source</a> ]</li>
			</ul>
